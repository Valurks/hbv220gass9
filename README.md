# Assignment 10 – Composite Pattern
This project demonstrates the use of the **Composite Design Pattern** in Java.  
It evaluates arithmetic expressions using a combination of `NumberLeaf`, `PlusComposite`, and `MultiplyComposite` components.

## Overview
The example implemented in `Main.java` evaluates the expression:

This is achieved by:
- Creating leaf nodes for numbers
- Combining them using composite nodes for addition and multiplication
- Evaluating the expression via `getResult()` calls

## Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- Apache Maven
